This script parses the data contained in the iTunes Library, extracts song ratings, and applies them to the Rhythmbox Library.

To use:

Import all of your music from your iTunes music directory into Rhythmbox.
Run: python transferRatings-x.x.x.py /path/to/itunes/library [/path/to/rhythmbox/library]
Usually the Rhythmbox library is located at ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml.
