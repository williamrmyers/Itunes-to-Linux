itunes-to-Linux
===============

This program will transfer i-tunes database metadata to a Linux based Media Player

The Mission:
A love of Music shouldn't keep you from moving to Linux. 

Non super users who have a vast library of music including play counts and metadata should have an easy way to switch Between Media players without losing that information.


Execution: 
This program should convert ratings and play counts between as many Media Players as possible, ideally once completed it will operate from a website for maximum accessibility.
