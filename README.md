Itunes-to-Linux
===============

This program will transfer Itunes database metadata to a Linux based Media Player

The Mission:
A love of Music shouldnt keep you from moving to Linux. 

Non super users who have a vast library of music including playcounts and metadata should have an easy way to switch Between Media players without losing that Information.

Execution: 
This program should convert ratings and play counts between as many Media Players as possible, ideally once completed it will operate from a website for maximum accessibility.
